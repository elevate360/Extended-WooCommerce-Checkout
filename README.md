# Extended-WooCommerce-Checkout
A custom WordPress plugin used to provide additional checkout options for end users. 

##How it works
This plugin works by adding additional settings to WooCommerce. It's function is to let users skil directly to the checkout on product addition.

It also potentially limits the user to only single purchases (empties the cart on additional product selection)
